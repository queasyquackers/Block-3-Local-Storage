{"text": "The Classical Receptor Occupancy Model", "explanation": "The classical model postulates that receptors are quiescent (inactive) unless activated by a ligand."},
{"text": "The Two-State Receptor Occupancy Model", "explanation": "The two-state model postulates that receptors exist in equilibrium between an active (Ra) and inactive (Ri) state, with the Ra fraction producing the basal or constitutive activity."},
{"text": "The Law of Mass Action Model", "explanation": "The Law of Mass Action describes drug binding equilibrium, not basal activity."},
{"text": "The Spare Receptor Model", "explanation": "The spare receptor model relates receptor occupancy to maximal effect, independent of constitutive activity."},
{"text": "The Irreversible Antagonism Model", "explanation": "This describes a type of binding, not the receptor's basal state."}
