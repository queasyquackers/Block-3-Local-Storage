Osteopathic structural exam reveals L3's left transverse process is significantly more posterior than the right. When the patient is instructed to bend forward into **Child's Pose** (full lumbar flexion), the transverse process asymmetry at L3 is **most improved (more symmetrical)**. Which somatic dysfunction diagnosis is most appropriate for L3?",
"options": [
{"text": "L3 Flexed, Rotated Right, Sidebent Right (FRS R)", "explanation": "This diagnosis implies the segment is most free in flexion, rotation right, and sidebending right, but the asymmetry improved with flexion, which suggests FRS Left or ERS Right is incorrect."},
{"text": "L3 Extended, Rotated Left, Sidebent Left (ERS L)", "explanation": "This diagnosis implies the segment is restricted in flexion, not eased by it; therefore, the asymmetry would likely worsen or remain unchanged in flexion, not improve."},
{"text": "L3 Flexed, Rotated Left, Sidebent Left (FRS L)", "explanation": "The segment's posterior left transverse process indicates a rotation right dysfunction (named for freedom of motion), not rotation left."},
{"text": "L3 Extended, Rotated Right, Sidebent Right (ERS R)", "explanation": "Extended dysfunctions (ERS) become more symmetrical in extension, not flexion."},
{"text": "L3 Flexed, Rotated Right, Sidebent Right (FRS R)", "explanation": "The **posterior left TP** means rotation ease is **Right** (vertebral body rotates toward the posterior TP side). Improvement in flexion (Child's Pose) names it **Flexed**. Following Type II mechanics, rotation and sidebending are coupled to the same side. Thus: **FRS R** (Flexed, Rotated Right, Sidebent Right)."}
