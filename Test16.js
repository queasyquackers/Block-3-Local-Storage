      {"text": "A therapeutic trial of fiber and laxatives", "explanation": "This is incorrect. A therapeutic trial is not appropriate in the presence of 'red flag' symptoms."},
      {"text": "Biofeedback therapy", "explanation": "This is incorrect. This is a treatment for defecatory disorders, and 'red flags' must be evaluated first."},
      {"text": "Anorectal manometry", "explanation": "This is incorrect. This specialized test is not the first step when 'red flag' symptoms are present."},
      {"text": "Endoscopic evaluation", "explanation": "This is correct. Recent onset of constipation, weight loss, and heme-positive stools are all 'red flag' indications for an endoscopic evaluation to rule out malignancy."},
      {"text": "Checking a TSH level", "explanation": "This is incorrect. While hypothyroidism can cause constipation, the combination of weight loss and blood in the stool makes colon cancer a much higher suspicion that must be evaluated first."}

      {"text": "Colon cancer", "explanation": "This is incorrect. Colon cancer is typically associated with *weight loss*, not weight gain."},
