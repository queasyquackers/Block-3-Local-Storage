"options": [
{"text": "This is a normal finding, suggesting no splenomegaly.", "explanation": "This is an abnormal finding. A normal spleen should remain tympanitic even during inspiration."},
{"text": "This is an abnormal finding, suggestive of splenomegaly.", "explanation": "Correct. A spleen that becomes dull upon inspiration (a positive splenic percussion sign) suggests splenic enlargement, as the enlarged spleen is pushed down and forward into the percussion area."},
{"text": "This finding is indeterminate and requires a CT scan.", "explanation": "While a CT would be needed for confirmation, this finding is a positive sign for splenomegaly."},

"options": [
{"text": "Perform deep palpation of the right lower quadrant first to confirm the diagnosis.", "explanation": "This is incorrect. Palpating the painful area first will cause guarding and discomfort, making the rest of the exam unreliable."},
{"text": "Examine the painful area (right lower quadrant) last.", "explanation": "Correct. To minimize patient discomfort and prevent voluntary guarding that could obscure findings in other quadrants, the area of pain should always be examined last."},
{"text": "Skip auscultation as it is not relevant in appendicitis.", "explanation": "Auscultation is critical; appendicitis can cause peritoneal irritation, leading to hypoactive or absent bowel sounds, which must be assessed *before* palpation."},

"options": [
{"text": "T5-T9", "explanation": "These levels typically correspond to the upper GI tract (stomach, liver, duodenum, pancreas)."},
