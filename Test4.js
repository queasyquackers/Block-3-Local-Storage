"questionText": "A patient with suspected cranial nerve dysfunction presents with difficulty lifting their soft palate to seal the nasopharynx during swallowing. This action relies on the coordinated motor innervation of the soft palate muscles (excluding the tensor veli palatini) provided by CN X (Vagus). This motor innervation is provided by which specific branch of the Vagus nerve?",
"options": [
{"text": "Recurrent laryngeal nerve", "explanation": "The RLN is motor to the intrinsic laryngeal muscles."},
{"text": "Inferior laryngeal nerve", "explanation": "The ILN is another name for the terminal RLN, innervating intrinsic laryngeal muscles."},
